# Customer Segmentation Analysis
Project Description
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing the Mall Customer Segmentation Data, we can group customers into distinct clusters based on features like age, annual income, and spending score. The analysis includes visualizations of data distributions, violin plots, and the results of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
